    ./shocking_pink

Assuming your terminal is in the usual 80x24 configuration, this will fill the console
with white x characters on a shocking pink background, with a single y character on a
light blue background at position (10, 15).  Your command prompt will likely continue
from that location since that is where the cursor last rested.
